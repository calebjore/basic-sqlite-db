This project writes to and reads from an SQLite database!

`db_build.ipynb` uses the `sqlite3` library to create `library.db` with three tables: authors, genres, and books, defining the foreign key relationships along the way. `db_pull.ipynb` queries the database via SQL. 

Though rudimentary, this is the first time I've built and queried a database from scratch, deepening my knowledge of integration Python and SQL for effective data workflows.
